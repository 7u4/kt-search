Pull requests are welcome generally. Also filing issues, doing documentation, etc. is appreciated. My intention is to support this project for longer term than my previous effort to do an elasticsearch client. 

Before starting on any big pull requests, please file an issue and/or ping me on @jillesvangurp on twitter or several other platforms where I go by the same handle. This is so we can avoid conflicts/disappointment and coordinate changes. Especially for API changes, big refactorings, etc.

I try to be responsive processing PRs and critical issues. Otherwise, I have to balance working on this with other stuff so I may not respond right away. If this blocks you, reach out on twitter so we can resolve things.
