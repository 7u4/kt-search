            Elasticsearch has a Query DSL and the Java Rest High Level Client comes with a very expansive
            set of builders that you can use to programmatically construct queries. Of course builders are 
            something that you should avoid in Kotlin. 
            
            On this page we outline a few ways in which you can build queries both programmatically using the builders
            that come with the Java client, using json strings, and using our **Kotlin DSL**.
            
            We will use the same example as before in ${
            com.jillesvangurp.eskotlinwrapper.documentation.mdLink(manualPages["search"])}. 
            
            ## Java Builders
            
            The Java client comes with `org.elasticsearch.index.query.QueryBuilders` which provides static methods 
            to create builders for the various queries. This covers most but probably not all of the query DSL 
            but should cover most commonly used things.

            Using `apply` gets rid of the need to chain all the calls and it is a little better but still a little verbose. 
            
            ## Kotlin Search DSL
            
            To address this, this library provides a Kotlin DSL that allows you to mix both type safe DSL constructs 
            and simple schema-less manipulation of maps. We'll show several versions of the same query above to
            show how this works.
            
            The example below uses the type safe way to set up the same query as before.

                    // and delegates to a simple MutableMap.

            ## Extending the DSL
            
            The Elasticsearch DSL is huge and only a part is covered in our Kotlin DSL so far. Currently, most 
            compound, text, and term level queries are supported.
            
            Using the DSL
            in schema-less mode allows you to work around this and you can of course mix both approaches.
            
            However, if you need something added to the DSL it is really easy to do this yourself. For example 
            this is the implementation of the match we use above:
