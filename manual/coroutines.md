# Co-routines

The RestHighLevelClient exposes asynchronous versions of most APIs that take a call back to process
the response when it comes back. Using this is kind of boiler plate heavy. 

Luckily, Kotlin has co-routines for asynchronous programming and this library provides co-routine 
friendly versions of these functions. These `suspend` functions work pretty much the same way as their 
synchronous version except they are marked as suspend and use a `SuspendingActionListener` that uses
Kotlin's `suspendCancellableCoroutine` to wrap the callback that the rest high level client expects.

As of Elasticsearch 7.5.0, all asynchronous calls return a `Cancellable` object that allows you to cancel
the task. Using `suspendCancellableCoRoutine` uses this and this means that if you have some failure
or abort a coroutine scope, all the running tasks are cancelled. 

If you use an asynchronous server framework such as Ktor or Spring Boot 2.x (in reactive mode), you'll
want to use the asynchronous functions.

To support co-routines, this project is using a 
[code generation plugin](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/es-kotlin-codegen-plugin) 
to generate the co-routine friendly versions of each of the
Rest High Level async functions. At this point most of them are covered. There are more than a hundred 
of these. 

As an example, here are three ways to use the reloadAnalyzers API:

```kotlin
// the synchronous version as provided by the RestHighLevel client
val ic = esClient.indices()
val response = ic.reloadAnalyzers(
  ReloadAnalyzersRequest("myindex"), RequestOptions.DEFAULT
)

// the asynchronous version with a callback as provided by the
// RestHighLevel client
ic.reloadAnalyzersAsync(ReloadAnalyzersRequest("myindex"),
  RequestOptions.DEFAULT, object : ActionListener<ReloadAnalyzersResponse> {
    override fun onFailure(e: Exception) {
      println("it failed")
    }

    override fun onResponse(response: ReloadAnalyzersResponse) {
      println("it worked")
    }
  })

runBlocking {
  // the coroutine friendly version using a function generated by the
  // code generator plugin this is a suspend version so we put it in
  // a runBlocking to get a coroutine scope use a more appropriate
  // scope in your own application of course.
  val response = ic.reloadAnalyzersAsync(
    ReloadAnalyzersRequest("myindex"), RequestOptions.DEFAULT
  )
}
```

## AsyncIndexRepository

In addition to having suspend versions of most functions in the `RestHighLevelClient`, the 
`IndexRepository` also has an `AsyncIndexRepository` counter part. The API of this is
similar to the regular repository. 

```kotlin
// you can create a new repository via an extension function
val asyncRepo = esClient.asyncIndexRepository<Thing>("asyncthings")

// all functions on the asyncRepo are of course suspend so we
// need to run them in a co-routine
runBlocking {
  asyncRepo.createIndex {
    source(
      """
    {
      "settings": {
      "index": {
        "number_of_shards": 3,
        "number_of_replicas": 0,
        "blocks": {
        "read_only_allow_delete": "false"
        }
      }
      },
      "mappings": {
      "properties": {
        "title": {
        "type": "text"
        }
      }
      }
    }
  """, XContentType.JSON
    )
  }
}
```

```kotlin
// all functions on the asyncRepo are of course suspend so we
// need to run them in a co-routine scope
runBlocking {
  // all of these use suspend functions
  asyncRepo.index("thing1", Thing("The first thing"))
  // this uses the `AsyncBulkIndexingSession`, which uses the new
  // `Flow` API underneath.
  asyncRepo.bulk {
    for (i in 2.rangeTo(10)) {
      index("thing_$i", Thing("thing $i"))
    }
  }
  asyncRepo.refresh()
  val count = asyncRepo.count { }
  println("indexed $count items")
}
```

Output:

```
indexed 10 items

```

## Asynchronous search

The search API is very similar; except for the returned AsyncSearchResults. The 
results make use of the `Flow` api in the Kotlin Co-Routines library.

```kotlin
runBlocking {
  val results = asyncRepo.search(scrolling = true) {
    dsl {
      query = matchAll()
    }
  }

  // hits returns a Flow<Thing>
  println("Hits: ${results.hits().count()}")
}
```

Output:

```
Hits: 10

```
