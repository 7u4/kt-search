# Elasticsearch Kotlin Client Manual 

The [Elasticsearch Kotlin Client](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/es-kotlin-wrapper-client) is a client 
library written in Kotlin that 
adapts the [Highlevel Elasticsearch HTTP client for Java](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/java-rest-high.html) provided by Elasticsearch.

## Introduction

The official Java client provides client functionality for essentially everything exposed by their REST
API. The Elasticsearch Kotlin Client makes using this functionality more Kotlin friendly. 

It does this through extension functions that add many useful features and shortcuts. It adds Kotlin DSLs for
querying, defining mappings, and bulk indexing. To facilitate the most common use cases, this library
also provides a Repository abstraction that enables the user to interact with an index in a way that
is less boilerplate heavy.

Additionally, it provides co-routine friendly versions of the asynchronous clients in the Java library.
This enables the user to write fully reactive code in e.g. Ktor or Spring Boot. This makes this
library the easiest way to do this currently.
