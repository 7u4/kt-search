# Demo Page

A quick example. You can put any markdown here.
Once this code runs, it actually generates the page [you can open it here](demo.md)

```kotlin
// Block receives a PrintWriter so the output of the block is captured and shown.
println("Hello world")
```

Output:

```
Hello world

```

We use a few kotlin helpers for links:

- You can link to another page [Es Kotlin Wrapper Client Manual](index.md) (gets you back to the manual page if you
clicked the demo.md link).
- You can link to the source of any class [`KotlinForExample`](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/es-kotlin-wrapper-client/tree/master/src/test/kotlin/io/inbot/eskotlinwrapper/manual/KotlinForExample.kt)
