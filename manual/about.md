# About this manual

## About this manual

This manual is an attempt at 
[literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).

## Epub support.

I'm also thinking about eventually publishing an ebook version of the manual at some point. The build 
currently produces scripts in the epub directory that allow you to create an epub using pandoc. This 
is very much a work in progress but was a big motivation for me to sink time in creating this 
little literate programming framework.

You can find the latest epub
[here](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/es-kotlin-wrapper-client/blob/master/book.epub).
