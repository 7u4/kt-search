# About this manual 

This manual is an attempt at 
[literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming). When I 
started writing it, I quickly discovered that copying bits of source code to quickly leads to broken
or inaccurate documentation samples. I fixed it by hacking together a solution to grab code samples
from Kotlin through reflection and by making some assumptions about where source files are in a typical
gradle project.

Eventually, I turned that into a separate project called [kotlin4example](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/kotlin4example)
This manual is the first of (hopefully) many projects that use it.

## Epub support.

I'm also thinking about eventually publishing an ebook version of the manual at some point. The build 
currently produces scripts in the epub directory that allow you to create an epub using pandoc. This 
is very much a work in progress but was a big motivation for me to sink time in creating this 
little literate programming framework.

You can find the latest epub
[here](https://github.com/jillesvangurp/es-kotlin-wrapper-client/blob/master/book.epub).
